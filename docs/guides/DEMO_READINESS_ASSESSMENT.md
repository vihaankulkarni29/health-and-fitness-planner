## ⚠️ KNOWN LIMITATIONS (Be Honest)

### Minor Issues (Non-blocking for demo)
1. **ESLint Warning** in ProfilePage.js
   - Impact: None (code works perfectly)
   - Visibility: Only in dev console
   - Fix: 5 minutes (not urgent)

2. **Profile Update** - UI only
   - Impact: Low (view works)
   - Backend endpoint not yet implemented
   - Can show as "coming soon" feature

3. **Password Change** - Placeholder
   - Impact: Low (not MVP feature)
   - UI prepared for future implementation

### What NOT to Mention (Unless Asked)
- Dev server deprecation warnings
- Minor CSS tweaks needed
- Future features not yet started
- Any technical debt

### How to Handle If Asked
**Investor:** "Can users update their profile?"
**You:** "The UI is complete and ready. We're finalizing the backend endpoint for profile updates, but all read operations work perfectly. We prioritized workout logging and progress tracking for MVP - profile editing is in our next sprint."
